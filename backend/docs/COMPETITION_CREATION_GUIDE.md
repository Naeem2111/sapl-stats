# Competition Creation & SAPL Integration Guide

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for the new competition creation system and SAPL integration features in the Pro Clubs Stats Hub.

## üèÜ Overview

The competition creation system allows administrators to:

- Create cup tournaments with various formats
- Integrate with SAPL to fetch and sync teams
- Manage tournament brackets and standings
- Track match results and statistics
- Handle different tournament formats (knockout, group stages, etc.)

## üîó SAPL Integration

### What is SAPL?

SAPL (Soccer Association Pro League) is an external system that provides team data and league information. Our system integrates with SAPL to:

- Fetch all available teams
- Sync team information automatically
- Maintain consistency between systems
- Import team logos and metadata

### SAPL API Endpoints

#### Test Connection

```http
GET /api/sapl/test-connection
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Required Role:** COMPETITION_ADMIN

#### Fetch SAPL Teams

```http
GET /api/sapl/teams
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Required Role:** COMPETITION_ADMIN, LEAGUE_ADMIN
