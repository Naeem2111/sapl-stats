# Competition Admin API Guide

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for all API endpoints available to users with the `COMPETITION_ADMIN` role. Competition admins have full access to the system, including features not yet built in the frontend.

## Authentication

All API requests require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

## Role Hierarchy

- **COMPETITION_ADMIN**: Full system access (highest level)
- **LEAGUE_ADMIN**: User management, team management, season management
- **TEAM_ADMIN**: Team management, player management
- **PLAYER**: View own stats, view team info

## Error Handling

All API endpoints return consistent error responses:

```json
{
	"success": false,
	"error": {
		"message": "Detailed error description"
	}
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:

- `200`: Success
- `201`: Created

- `401`: Unauthorized
- `403`: Forbidden
- `404`: Not Found
- `500`: Internal Server Error

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting:

- **Window**: 15 minutes
- **Limit**: 100 requests per IP address
- **Headers**: `X-RateLimit-*` headers included in responses

## Security Features

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection protection
- CORS configuration
- Helmet security headers
- Rate limiting protection

## Development Notes

### Testing Endpoints

Use the provided Postman collection or test with curl:

```bash
# Login and get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# Use token for authenticated requests
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/system-overview \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

### Database Schema

The system uses Prisma with PostgreSQL. Key models:

- `User`: User accounts and roles
- `Team`: Football teams
- `Player`: Player profiles
- `Season`: Competition seasons
- `Match`: Individual matches
- `PlayerMatchStat`: Player performance in matches
- `Badge`: Achievement badges
- `AwardedBadge`: Badge assignments

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Support and Development

For questions or feature requests:

1. Check the main README.md for setup instructions
2. Review the database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
3. Test endpoints using the provided Postman collection
4. Check server logs for detailed error information
